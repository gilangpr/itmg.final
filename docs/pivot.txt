STEP 1 :
create view history_extended as (
  select
    history.*,
    case when itemname = "A" then itemvalue end as A,
    case when itemname = "B" then itemvalue end as B,
    case when itemname = "C" then itemvalue end as C
  from history
);

select * from history_extended;

----------------------

STEP 2 :
create view history_itemvalue_pivot as (
  select
    hostid,
    sum(A) as A,
    sum(B) as B,
    sum(C) as C
  from history_extended
  group by hostid
);

-----------------------

STEP 3:
create view history_itemvalue_pivot_pretty as (
  select 
    hostid, 
    coalesce(A, 0) as A, 
    coalesce(B, 0) as B, 
    coalesce(C, 0) as C 
  from history_itemvalue_pivot 
);
